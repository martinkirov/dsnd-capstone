# Sparkify Capstone Project

This project is an assignment for the Data Science for Enterprise nanodegree with Udacity.

## Project Context

This project is part of the Capstone assignment with Udacity’s Data Science for Enterprise programme and it explores the user churn rate for Sparkify — a fictitious music streaming service whose dataset we will be using. We are provided with the 128mb of activity log for a number of users and the different activities that can be done via the (web) app.

### Problem Statement and High Level Plan

The problem at hand is to identify some of the factors that correlate to whether a user might churn or not. For the purposes of this project, we define churn rate as the user them completing the cancellation process and reaching the “Cancellation Completed” page.

The basic strategy to tackle this problem is to set everything up in a scalable high-level process so that I can expand if I have any time left.

In short:

1. Load the dataset

2. Clean up any rubbish and we will add our churn and downgrade flags

3. Explore the dataset and learn some basic insghts about it

4. Construct a new dataset containing only the features we want (all based on the activity log)

5. Add features to the new dataset (as many as time permits)

6. Load everything up and try out a few models to see how well they are predicting

The “scalable” part comes in at step 4, where once we have completed the run, we can just keep adding (and removing) any features we want.
